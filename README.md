# Concatenation-Challenge

## Project Description

Find the longest word in a file that is made up of other words in the file.<br/>

## Project History

Originally this was the IBM Aspera onboarding coding challenge.<br/>
However, they have since depricated this practice, so it felt only propper to upload it here.<br/>
